CEON’s Material is a class under Matter, conceptually “the stuff products are made of.” Despite the hierarchy difference, these classes refer to the same real-world category (materials like steel, plastic, wood). We align dppo:Material to ceon-material:Material as equivalent in intention, with the caveat that in CEON a Material is not a Product. In practice, this means if a DPP instance is typed as Material, we treat it as an instance of CEON Material (and not simultaneously a CEON Product). This alignment is semantically sound: DPP’s broad notion of product covers materials, but when translating to CEON, we cast those to the Material branch. This is a specialization alignment, effectively partitioning DPP’s Product category into CEON’s Product vs Material depending on the instance’s DPP subtype." ;

    rdfs:comment "CEON does not have built-in classes for “substance of concern,” but DPPO defines these as special Substance subclasses per EU regulation. We align this by treating DPPO’s concern subclasses as subclasses of CEON’s ChemicalEntity or ChemicalSubstance. For example, map dppo:ToxicSubstance as subclass of ceon-material:ChemicalSubstance, and similarly for others. This maintains the intent (they are chemical substances) within CEON’s structure. The alignment type is partial: it introduces new specialization in CEON’s hierarchy. CEON’s material module can accommodate this extension (it was designed to be extended for domain-specific material classes). The mapping is justified because it enriches CEON with DPPO’s regulatory nuance – something CEON currently lacks. Conversely, from a CEON perspective, one could treat these alignments as annotations (e.g., link a substance to an external regulatory classification). But for ontology alignment, subclassing is straightforward and retains semantics (any DPP ToxicSubstance is a CEON ChemicalSubstance with an added property “is toxic” or simply by class membership)." ;
